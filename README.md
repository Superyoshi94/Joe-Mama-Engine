# Joe-Mama-Engine
 An FNF engine with features like ghost tapping with, miss counters, chart grid placing and a way better engine.
 
 Improvements:
 Chart gridding, Pressing b m or m changes a grid snap from halfs, thirds and quads.
 Engine, way better engine, hitting notes works now, ghost tapping too. (Did you know that you yourself can make the fnf engine better very easily?)
